#summary Coders' guidelines
#labels Phase-Implementation

# Introduction #
The very first thing that Mojito needs is a **good** coder. The last thing that Mojito needs is a bad coder.

# What's good, what's bad #
I'm not a C guru, and I don't want to teach you nothing: I simply took (in these nearly 10 years of C-programming experience) some conventions and I stick to them.

I don't know if they are good/bad/right/stinky/whatever: any patch that doesn't follow the Mojito coding style will be dropped, no matter what (I'm not so Nazist actually, the first times I'll redirect you here asking politely to adjust your code).

# Practically? #
The main guideline is to follow the K&R style, and more specifically the linux kernel coding one, that is well described in a file called CodingStyle (that you can easily find in the Documentation/ folder of the mainstream kernel source package (or the /usr/src/linux/Documentation of your linux box, obviously <sup>_</sup>)).

If you are in doubt just ask!
