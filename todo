check what happens in a header() call in a PHP script while executing in a CGI
    evironment

check for known exploit and try to solve them:
    1- on post requests, we wait for content-lenght post data to be received. An
        attacker could declare a bigger content-lenght on many requests: mojito
        will spawn a child for each request, suffering a DOS attack. A possible
        solution is to insert a timeout (maybe an adaptive one based on header
        speed?)
    2- check what happens if an incomplete header is sent. This situation 
        should be dealt right, but it's better to check with a specific 
        program ;-)
    3- Mojito will run cgi with post_fd put on stdin only if some post-data has
        been sent by the client: otherwise it will not detach the parent stdin,
        leaving the control to the cgi app. Check if this could be harmful and
        find a solution.
